# What is this project?
This project is designed to help you keep track of the jobs you’ve applied for - including key details like company, role, application date, and current stage in the hiring process.

It's meant to be a simple personal tool to stay organized during a job search.

# Learning a New Technology
I’m currently learning React, and this project is a way for me to gain real hands-on experience while also building something useful.

The goal is to improve my frontend development skills and gain more familiarity with modern JavaScript tooling.

# Tech Stack
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* React 
* Ajax (maybe)
* Git
* Docker (maybe)

## Current Features
Right now, the application includes:

* Home Page - basic landing page for the app

* Profile Page (temporary) - 
A section where you can enter your name and see the information displayed back.
(No data is stored — this is purely a frontend project. This feature may be removed later.)

* Applications Page - the core functionality
You can input job application details and they will appear in a clean, structured table.
Data persists using LocalStorage, so refreshing the page won’t remove your entries.

# Upcoming Feature
* Light & Dark Mode - you will be able to toggle between the two modes.
* and much more...
