# What is this Project?
This project is designed to help you keep track of the jobs you’ve applied for - including key details like company, role, application date, and current stage in the hiring process.

It's meant to be a simple personal tool to stay organized during a job search.

# Learning a New Technology
I’m currently learning React, and this project is a way for me to gain real hands-on experience while also building something useful.

The goal is to improve my frontend development skills and gain more familiarity with modern JavaScript tooling.

# Tech Stack
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* React 
* Ajax (maybe)
* Git
* Docker (maybe)

# Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Job-Application-Tracker.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd Job-Application-Tracker`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the app: `npm start`
5. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

# Usage
- Go to the Applications page.
- Fill in the fields with job application details.
- Click "Record This Job" to add it to your table.
- Data is stored locally, so it persists even after refreshing.

# Current Features
Right now, the application includes:

* Home Page - basic landing page for the app

* Profile Page (temporary) - 
A section where you can enter your name and see the information displayed back.
(No data is stored - this is purely a frontend project. This feature may be removed later.)

* Applications Page - the core functionality. You can input job application details and they will appear in a clean, structured table.
Data persists using LocalStorage, so refreshing the page won’t remove your entries.

# Upcoming Feature
* Light & Dark Mode - you will be able to toggle between the two modes.
* and much more...

# Contributing
* This is a personal project for learning purposes. Contributions are welcome!
